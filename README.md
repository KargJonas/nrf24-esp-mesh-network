# nRF24-L01 + ESP8266 Mesh Network

## I plan on building a mesh network consisting of four 10x7x2.3cm transparent plastic boxes, each equipped with the following hardware:
- 1x Nrf24-L01 Long range 2.4GHz transceiver with antenna [ 0.0009 - 15mA ]
- 1x Nrf24 base module for power regulation/data "smoothing"/interference reduction.
- 1x ESP8266-12F WiFi module/microprocessor [ 0.01 - 170mA ]
- 1x 0.9" 128x32 OLED I2C Display [ 8 - 12mA ] (Will be disabled unless wake button is pressed)
- 1x Adjustable step down converter => ~4.5V to 3.3V [ Advertised efficiency: 97% expected efficiency: 80-90% ]
- 3x AA Battery + Holder => connected in series to reach ~4.5V [ 400 - 2400mAh (* ~0.9 because of efficiency of step down converter) ]
- 1x 2-Position power switch
- 1x momentary push button => Wake display / GUI input
- 1x piezo buzzer for locating the devices or indicating an error/battery-low state.

Expected cost for 4pcs: ~30\$.<br>
Actual cost: 34\$. (All components were ordered from AliExpress.com)<br>

Pessimistic battery-runtime: (400mAh * 0.8)  / (15mA + 170mA + 12mA) = ~1.6h<br>
Optimistic battery-runtime:  (2400mAh * 0.9) / (4mA + 80mA + 0mA)    = ~25.7h<br>
Realistic battery-runtime:   (1.6h + 25.7h)  / 2                     = ~13.7h

## Configuration:
I expect a range of 400-700m between two of the Nrf24 chips and a range of ~8m for the ESP8266s. The idea is to provide a (pretty slow) LAN network by connecting the Nrf24s with each other and using the ESPs, which would each be physically connected to a NRF, as access points for regular WiFi devices. I expect a data transfer speed of around 1-2mBit.

## Potential issues:
- Interference (ESP/NRF/power-supply) => Shielding / Input voltage smoothing?
- Batteries/PS - Amperage/Voltage
- Lower-than-expected transfer speeds (various reasons)

## Hardware setup (used for testing):
I am using two NodeMCU dev boards, each with their own nRF24-L01 chip, for testing.<b>
The nRFs are connected to the ESPs via the hardware SPI interface.</b><br>

| NRF24-L01 | NodeMCU |
| --------- | ------- |
| GND       | GND     |
| VCC       | VCC     |
| CE        | D4      |
| SCK       | D5      |
| MISO      | D6      |
| MOSI      | D7      |
| CSN       | D8      |

<b>ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: D8 must pulled low using a ~4.75k Ohm resistor to enable hardware serial. ðŸš¨</b>

```cpp
// D4 and D8 are the "interesting" pins.
RF24 radio(D4, D8);
```

## Other notes:
The ESP8266 has a Watch-Dog-Timer (WDT), which aims to prevent the board from freezing in e.g. a "endless" loop. To prevent the timer from expiring and thus resetting the ESP, you have to either disable it using `ESP.wdtDisable();`, adjust it for your purposes with `ESP.wdtEnable(MILLISECOND_AMOUNT);` or just calling `yield();` every once in a while (`yield()` is also called after every `loop()`);<br>
Watch out for blocking operations in the libraries you use (e.g. `NRF24.waitAvailable()`).<br>
A great tool for developing with the ESP8266 is **PlatformIO**.<br>

## ToDo:
- Plan layout in case for min interference
- Waterproofing
  - Do I even care about that? (yeah - at least a bit of waterproofing..)
  - What about the antenna?
  - Buttons on inside or outside?
- What stuff on display?
  - Battery status.
  - Connection
    - How many nodes
    - Packet loss
- Wiring
  - Circuit diagram
  - Design a PCB
